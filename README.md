Digital image processing is a fundamental field in computer vision and image analysis. Convolution is a key operation in image processing that allows us to apply filters or masks to an image to achieve various effects like blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more.
In this project, we demonstrate how convolution works and provide practical examples of its applications in digital image processing.
